      Smart home technology which may also be termed Home automation
      is the use of devices in the home that connect via a network.
      It uses devices such as sensors and other appliances connected
      to the Internet of things (IoT) that can be remotely monitored,
      controlled or accessed and provide services that respond to
      the perceived needs of the users.
